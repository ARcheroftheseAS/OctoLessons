      <h1>~Welcome~</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;">This is MintAloe's test page, I hope that you're well. <br> 
        I've included what could be some helpful information for those looking to code on the site. <br> 
        Please enjoy!
      </p>  

      <h2>GitHub and GitKraken, Notes to Self</h2>
      <p>The following are instructions on GitHub and GitKraken:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure that your document is properly saved, it may be accidently overwritten in the process.</li>
        <li>Open GitKraken and look for the <em>pull</em> button ontop, <strong>not to be confused with pull request.</strong></li>
        <li>Click on the arrow and do a <em>Rebase Pull</em> in order to sync up with everyone else's work, this is where your stuff might be overwritten.</li>
        <li>Click on your branch on the tree and stage your changes, adding a concise description</li>
        <li>Commit your changes and click the <em>push</em> button next to the pull button</li>
        <li>Now look at the sidebar and make a <em>pull request (+)</em>, it will go from your repository to GHS Game Design</li>
        <li>If the push is successful, congradulations, you are done. If not... Good luck. Our thoughts and prayers go with you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>HTML Notes</h2>
      <p>My <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNd_0P39MLmeqyiYhy9h6VcHy4cO4MwrhpIxK4TnfH8/edit?usp=sharing">HTML Notes</a> 
        can be found online. If you would like to view, please contact me on the devteam chat. I do apologise for the 
        inconvience, however, the examples are directly from CodeAcademy and thus, I'm not sure that I can publish it online.

      <h2>CSS Notes</h2>
      <p>I do have some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">CSS Notes</a>
      At the moment, however, due to their measley state, I'm afraid that I would not reccomend them, as evidenced
      by this graphic masterpiece of a page. Nevertheless, if you would like to indulge your morbid curioursity, 
      I <em>encourage</em> you to check it out.</p>
